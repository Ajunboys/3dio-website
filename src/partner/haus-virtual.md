    - TITLE: 3D Dollhouse Project
      DESCRIPTION: Our client had just broken ground in one of Calgary’s most desirable inner city neighbourhoods and was looking to sell their home before it was finished. In order to sell this home before it was finished and market it to potential home-buyers, we developed a fully furnished 3D dollhouse.

    - TITLE: Landing Page Development
      DESCRIPTION: A client of ours had requested a full marketing package from our team that included a 3D scan, custom landing page, and lead-generation coupled with PPC in order to sell a home that had been sitting on the market for over 6 months. The landing page generated additional leads for other homes in addition to out-of-city interest for the client’s business.
