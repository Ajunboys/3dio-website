# Ambassadors

### What is a 3d.io Ambassador?

Ambassadors are enthusiast developers helping the community and enabling others to build upon 3d.io.

As a 3d.io Ambassador you have the opportunity to help others make their vision into (virtual ;-)) reality and
help us to support you and others even more in creating interior spaces on the web.

### Benefits of becoming an Ambassador

* Access to (optional) "office hours" hangouts and the ambassadors community
* Preview access to new features
* Opportunities to present your projects and work on our blog and social media channels
* Insider knowledge, exchange with experts and support for community events
* Expedited support & remote tutorial sessions and webinars

### Apply to be an Ambassador

We care about the community and so do our ambassadors, so we are looking for people who

* have been experimenting or working with 3d.io
* are sharing their knowledge with the community
* show interest in working with us to improve the platform
