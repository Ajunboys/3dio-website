# Basic 3D Model from Floor Plan

3d.io converts 2D floor plans into beatiful interactive 3D models with ease. We offer [two quality standards](/floor-plan-to-3d-conversion.md):
* **Basic 3D Models** provided by 3d.io 
* **Professional 3D Models** provided by [certified partners](/partners.html)

This page explains the process of creating a basic 3D model which is fully editable and can be upgraded to a [professional 3d model](/floor-plan-to-3d-conversion.md) later.

## Input
Currently we accept JPGs, PNGs, GIFs, and PDFs. We are working on other formats. Below is an example. Note that:
- the document contains 4 different plans. The one which is supposed to be turned into a model is highlighted by a red box
- the scale of the plan is clearly indicated. If there are no clues as to what the real-world scale of the plan is we use door widths for scaling

## Result
We return a beautiful 3D floor plan to you, typically within 24 hours. Not only is this representation of interiors much easier to understand than a floor plan for most people, but it can now also be further improved in our <a href="https://spaces.archilogic.com/model/template/new">editor</a>. Please note that:
- all furniture, fixtures, and the kitchen are generic
- room heights are standard - you can adjust these too
